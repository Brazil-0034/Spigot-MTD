# Spigot-MTD
## [Schematic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit)-Like Build Saves
Stored as text documents intended for structures in block population.

## Commands
`/t1` First Position

`/t2` Second Position

`/tsave file` Save as file name

`/tpaste file` Paste as file name

## Formatting:

```Block Type, x1, x2, x3```
Coordinate is relative to player's position at save.
This offers a lightweight, plain-text alternative to WorldEdit schematics.
MTD is built for world generation (block population at runtime)
Running a chunk preloader isn't necessary.

## Todo

 - Blockface Support
 - Entities
 - NBT Blockdata
 - Direct Custom Structures (no middleman plugin)
